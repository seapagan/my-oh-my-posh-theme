# My Custom `oh-my-posh` Theme

This is my custom theme for the [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) prompt.
It is basically the `powerlevel10k_rainbow` theme with some minor changes,
including adding a transient prompt and changing slightly the Python venv
display.

I will be updating this theme as I see fit, feel free to use it as you see fit!
